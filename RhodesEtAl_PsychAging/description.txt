### data

ppt_no = unique participant ID
MemCondition = whether change detection was probed for color, shape, location, or binding of features
SetSize = number of to-be-remembered objects (3 or 6)
Condition = whether different probe types were mixed or separately blocked
Age_Group = younger or older
HR = hit rate
FAR = false-alarm rate
dprime = sensitivity measure from signal detection theory
criterion = a bias measure from signal detection theory
aprime & betaprime = alternative sensitivity and bias measures that are commonly used (there are many problems with these measures)
Pr & Br = sensitivity and bias measures from two-high threshold theory

### analysis.R

Produces the default JZS Bayes factor reported in the manuscript
